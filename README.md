# 🤖 AI Agents Playground

A hands-on repository for **building, experimenting, and deploying AI agents** step by step.  
This repo is focused on **practical agent design**, not just theory — from simple task automation agents to intelligent decision-making systems.

---

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is created to:
- Build **AI agents from scratch**
- Understand **agent architecture and workflows**
- Learn how agents plan, reason, and act
- Experiment with **LLMs, tools, memory, and APIs**
- Create **real-world usable agents**

Inspired by the idea of **“100 AI Agents in 100 Days”**, this repo grows incrementally with each agent.

## 🧠 What is an AI Agent?

An AI Agent is a system that:
1. **Perceives input** (user query, data, context)
2. **Reasons or plans** (using logic or LLMs)
3. **Takes actions** (API calls, calculations, decisions)
4. **Returns output** (response, task completion)
